# ToDoListServer

keywords nodejs, express, REST, Mongodb

ToDoListServer is a nodejs programme to manage a todo list held in an online Mongodb using REST

The server has been created to provide a consistent database backend to other UI projects that I have developed:

* nodejs
* React
* React Native
* Xamarin



## Database Set-up

The project depends on the create of a online Mongodb using https://cloud.mongodb.com.
Setting up an initial mongodb is free to get you started.
Once you have the mongodb set-up, then change the file db/DBConfig.js in this repository to your connect string.
